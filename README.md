The files in this repo are not meant for publick exporting. this is only beta linux testing for CI-vite config build

Ci vite build may be exceptional for UBUNTU linux building.
Progress indicators shows that connecting to linux servers will upload the Cmake code.
And it is not my fault that there are a lot of coding launguages in this repo. DONT BLAME ME. ITS FOR YML [CI] VITE CONFIG BUILD  :(
