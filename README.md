## ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ The files in this repo are not meant for public exporting. this is only beta Linux testing for the CI-vite config build ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Ci vite build may be exceptional for the UBUNTU Linux building.ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
Progress indicators show that connecting to Linux servers will upload the Cmake code.
And I don't believe that it is my fault that there are a lot of coding languages in this repo. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BLAME ME FOR THIS. IT'S FOR YML [CI] VITE CONFIG BUILD  :(
