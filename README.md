## The files in this repo are not meant for public exporting. this is only beta Linux testing for the CI-vite config build

Ci vite build may be exceptional for the UBUNTU Linux building.
Progress indicators show that connecting to Linux servers will upload the Cmake code.
And it is not my fault that there are a lot of coding languages in this repo. DON'T BLAME ME. IT'S FOR YML [CI] VITE CONFIG BUILD  :(
