## NOTES

Please regard that the repo  will clone another repo, then clone this repo, due to an unsuppported github coding language.

## ­ЪћЦ­ЪћЦ­ЪћЦ The files in this repo are not meant for public exporting. this is only beta Linux testing for the CI-vite config build ( This repo is for Proxy site builds, to configure your own website to a proxy and create a git repo for you.­ЪћЦ­ЪћЦ­ЪћЦ

­ЪћЦ­ЪћЦ­ЪћЦCi vite build may be exceptional for the UBUNTU Linux building.­ЪћЦ­ЪћЦ­ЪћЦ
Progress indicators show that connecting to Linux servers will upload the Cmake code.
And I don't believe that it is my fault that there are a lot of coding languages in this repo. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BLAME ME FOR THIS. IT'S FOR YML \[CI\] VITE CONFIG BUILD  :(

## So like we had to get a lot of bots into this repo because, without it, we can not deploy this properly, and security will fail, causing branch problems. Lets see, we have dependabot, imgbot, renovatebot, deepsource auto fix bot, deepsource io bot, pre-commit ci bot, pixeebot, and probaly more bots. (I wish we haden't decided to do this but we all had to agree that was the best option after our last meeting.) (also, that meeting lasted 3:19:?? (3 hours, 19 minutes, and ?? seconds.)
